## What is the project?
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

## Aim of the project:
#### This project is aiming to: 
- produce python code that can generate a random word
- accept input guesses from the user
- navigate these guesses of the word, within the given 5 lives
- add the correct letters guessed to the word_guessed list
- decrease the no. of lives for every incorrect guess

## What I learned
  #### I have learnt how to use abstraction and encapulation in order to keep my code looking as clean and understanable as possible
  #### I have also learnt how to effectively use a class and to remember to use self. before an attribute when it is in use

## Installation instructions:

## Usage instructions:
  #### The user must enter a charatcter that meets the requirements:

#### Following this they will be propmpted whether their entry met the requirements or not. Regardless on the entry, they will be prompted to enter another letter

## File structure of the project:
  #### this file is structured into sections of relevance. for example within the class Hangman, the methods are separated based on what they do.
  - The first being check_guess
  - The second being ask_for_input
